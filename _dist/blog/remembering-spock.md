I was about 7 years old when I was first introduced to Star Trek. My mom was a huge Trek fan - her love for the show began while watching the original series with my grandfather. I quickly fell in love with the show, the characters, the Federation, and the stories. The world of Star Trek has always fascinated me. It's an ideal universe. Conflict is resolved through diplomacy more often than combat. There is no money, not that there isn't trade, but pursuing wealth is not motivated by greet, but rather a desire to improve the world and do something you enjoy. The future is bright, humanity is in harmony with one another, and conflict is generally left to those on the outside.
